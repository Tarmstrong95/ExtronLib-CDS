class SerialInterface():
    """ This class provides an interface to a serial port. This class allows the user to send data over the serial port in a synchronous or asynchronous manner. This class is used for all ports capable of serial communication (e.g., Serial Ports, IR Serial Ports).

        >Note:
        > In synchronous mode, the user will use SendAndWait() to wait for the response.
        > In asynchronous mode, the user will assign a handler function to ReceiveData to handle responses.
        > If an IR/Serial port is passed in and it has already been instantiated as an IRInterface, an exception will be raised.

    Arguments:
     Host (extronlib.device) - handle to Extron device class that instantiated this interface class
     Port (string) - port name (e.g.  'COM1', 'IRS1')
     (optional) Baud (int) - baudrate
     (optional) Data (int) - number of data bits
     (optional) Parity (string) - 'None', 'Odd' or 'Even'
     (optional) Stop (int) - number of stop bits
     (optional) FlowControl (string) - 'HW', 'SW', or 'Off'
     (optional) CharDelay (float) - time between each character sent to the connected device
     (optional) Mode (string) - mode of the port, 'RS232', 'RS422' or 'RS485'

    Parameters:
    Baud - Returns (int) - the baud rate
    CharDelay - Returns (float) - inter-character delay
    Data - Returns (int) - the number of data bits
    FlowControl - Returns (string) - flow control
    Host - Returns (extronlib.device) - the host device
    Mode - Returns (string) - the current Mode
    Parity - Returns (string) - parity
    Port - Returns (string) - the port name this interface is attached to
    Stop - Returns (int) - number of stop bits

    Events:
    Offline - (Event) Triggers when port goes offline. The callback takes two arguments. The first one is the extronlib.interface instance triggering the event and the second one is a string ('Offline').
    Online - (Event) Triggers when port goes offline. The callback takes two arguments. The first one is the extronlib.interface instance triggering the event and the second one is a string ('Online'). 
    ReceiveData - (Event) Receive Data event handler used for asynchronous transactions. The callback takes two arguments. The first one is the SerialInterface instance triggering the event and the second one is a bytes string.
