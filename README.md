# ExtronLib-Code-Documentation-Support
This is a mock of the Extronlib library that allows you to edit globalscripter python files externally in an IDE of your choice and contains all documentation of extronlib in code with the help of intellisense


TODO:
- Finish cleaning up Docstrings
- Make sure types match documentation
- Make sure all classes and methods are available
- Make this globally installable with pip so a user doesnt have to copy pasta folders and shit
- Make sure all versions of extronlib are supported
